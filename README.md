# Todo App (Name Pending): Less Things, More Smarts
I'm trying my hand at writing an app. I don't know how well this will go but I really wanna try.

### Seriously? A to-do app?
So I really want an app to tell me what I need to work on next. I want to be able to input an estimated time to complete and a due date, both optional, and let the app sort out what's "higher priority" for me to work on. Current todo apps suck my life away trying to manage them and I end up abandoning it after a few days.
